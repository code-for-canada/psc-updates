One of the objectives of the Code for Canada program is for fellows to conduct user research in order to understand user needs, develop a product plan, and test assumptions about the problem space with candidates applying for middle-management level positions in the federal public service. User research provides a valuable baseline of data from which to scope an appropriate solution.

Since early November, we have been in the "discovery" phase of this project. We've done a number of interviews with internal stakeholders, read existing research on the problem space from our government partners, and recently concluded a month of interviews and field studies with current and prospective managers in the federal government. We also spoke to Scorers and Test Administrators -- our goal was to get a sense of who might come in contact with our product, and to make sure we understand their needs. We'd like to share some of our findings from the managerial experiences we've recorded.

**User Research Results Presentation**

What kind of research was done?
![User Research Slide 01](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_001.png "We do user research to gain understanding.")
![User Research Slide 04](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_004.png "This looked like using an outcomes approach, focusing on experience, 1-on-1 interviews, and observational field studies")

Who did we talk to?

![User Research Slide 06](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_006.png "We talked to 15 current managers, 3 scorers, 3 test admins, and 7 future managers.")
![User Research Slide 07](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_007.png "These people work in a variety of departments from Marketing to IT to Operations.")
![User Research Slide 08](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_008.png "The people we talked to spent an average of 9 years in a manager role")
![User Research Slide 09](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_009.png "73% of the people we talked to are English speakers.")
![User Research Slide 10](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_010.png "66% of the current managers we talked to are women.")
![User Research Slide 11](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_011.png "We spoke to participants from accross the country.")
![User Research Slide 12](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_012.png "We asked open ended questions about their experience as managers.")

What did we learn?

![User Research Slide 14](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_014.png "People were excited to talk to us, passionate about their job, and spent time preparing for interviews.")
![User Research Slide 15](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_015.png "Hiring pain points include barriers to entry, improving time to staff, and giving candidates tools to succeed.")
![User Research Slide 16](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_016.png "Feedback is important.")
![User Research Slide 17](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_017.png "7 participants reported not having the context or preparation to succeed.")
![User Research Slide 18](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_018.png "If they knew what they were being assessed on they might have done better.")
![User Research Slide 20](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_020.png "I'd be looking for someone's ability to research, read something and apply it elsewhere.")
![User Research Slide 26](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_026.png "Managers use a variety of email tools.")
![User Research Slide 27](../images/c4c-uxr/c4c_uxr_027.png "They also use paper notes, whiteboards, OneNote, and stickies.")

**Next**

But what happens next? To develop the best product, we believe that UXR never really stops, though it takes a different shape. We've identified some gaps in our existing research, and intend to undertake more targeted outreach to persons with disabilities, visible persons, and those living outside the national capital region. We'll also begin product testing in a few weeks. If you know someone who might be interested in this project, or if you're interested in being a part of product testing, check out our [recruitment page](https://code-for-canada.github.io/psc-partnership/).
