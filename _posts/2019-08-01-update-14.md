It's the end of the fellowship! We have spent the past month off-boarding our work onto the new team, reflecting on the past 10 months, and helping the PSC set sights for what's next.

This has included:
- final team retrospectives
- lots of pair programming and designing
- transfering accounts
- documenting the ways we work and recommendations for the future
- facilitating new relationships
- onboarding our new team members 

We're so grateful to the team that has put hard work into this project with us, and we're proud of what we've accomplished together. It would be impossible to list everything, but weâ€™re going to try. Here are some major highlights from #ProjectThunderCAT:

- Interviewed 30+ public servants across the country, and introduced user experience research to the department for the first time
- Introduced a new tech stack for the first time in 15+ years
- Introduced Agile methodologies that help build trust and alignment within the team
- Built a well-researched and tested product with a clear path to pilot

There is a lot of momentum to make a big impact at the PSC and we're happy to see others carry this work forward. Remember your work has real impact on the public service and Canadians.
